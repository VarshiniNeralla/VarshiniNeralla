# 👩‍💻 Varshini Neralla  
**Final-year Computer Science Student | Full-Stack Developer | AI & Intelligent Systems Builder**

Welcome — this is the central hub showcasing who I am, what I build, and where I’m headed in software engineering and AI.

I build **real-world applications**, **data-driven systems**, and **intelligent tools** focusing on full-stack development, machine learning integrations, and scalable software design.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a final-year Computer Science student passionate about:
- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, Angular)
- Artificial Intelligence & Multi-Agent Systems
- Data engineering and visualizations
- Solving real problems with real code

I enjoy transforming messy ideas into **well-architected, production-ready systems** and continuously stretch my capabilities into AI-driven automation and edge-capable applications.
